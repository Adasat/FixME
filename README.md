# JavaScript Error Practice Repository

Welcome to the JavaScript Error Practice Repository. This repository contains a collection of JavaScript code snippets intentionally designed with common errors. The goal is to help you improve your error detection and debugging skills by identifying and correcting these errors.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adasat/FixMe.git
   cd FixMe.js
   ```

2. **Explore the Error Examples:**
   Inside the repository, you will find various JavaScript files, each containing different types of errors. Open these files in your favorite code editor.

3. **Run the Code:**
   Execute each JavaScript file using Node.js or in the browser console to observe the errors.
   ```bash
   node filename.js
   ```

4. **Analyze the Errors:**
   Pay close attention to the error messages displayed in the terminal or console. These messages will give you clues about the nature of the error and where it is located in the code.

5. **Debug and Fix the Errors:**
   Use the information from the error messages to identify the source of the problem. Modify the code to fix the errors and re-run the file to ensure the issue is resolved.

## Types of Errors Included

- Missing parameter in a function
- Incorrectly closed object
- Incorrectly closed function
- Using a package that is not installed
- Syntax errors
- Undefined variables
- Accessing non-existent object properties
- Incorrect use of `const`
- Missing callback functions
- Promise handling errors
- And more...

## Example

Here's a simple example to get you started:

**File: `missing-parameter.js`**
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

greet();
```

**Terminal Output:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
    at greet (missing-parameter.js:2:21)
    at missing-parameter.js:5:1
```

In this example, the function `greet` expects a parameter `name`, but it is called without any arguments, leading to an error.

## Tips for Debugging

- Carefully read the error message and note the line number where the error occurred.
- Check for common issues like missing parameters, syntax errors, and incorrect use of variables.
- Use console logs to trace the flow of your program and understand the state of your variables at different points.
